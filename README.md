# Evolution-Simulator
Third attempt at a simple evolution simulation in Godot 4

This is my attempt to create an evolution simulation in Godot 4. Both of my previous attempts ended up trying to do too much too quickly, and
the animals were only able to evolve physically. In this simulation, I will be adding neural networks to all the creatures, which will allow
for both physical and behavioral evolution over time.
